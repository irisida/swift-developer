### Angela Yu - iOS 13 version on Udemy

The course can be found [here.](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/) It aims to provide a fairly comprehensive tour of beginner iOS development. Projects are mostly trivial or contrived. Courses acts as a reasonable introduction to Swift 5.x, using Xcode and general UIKit basics. Course feels dated as it's an annually updated course rather than freshly cut for the state of iOS development as of iOS14.
