# I know nothing!

I've owned a Mac of some form or other for well over a decade, probably close to 13 years. In all that time I can't say I haven't thought about learning Objective C, subsequently Swift, but much like it was for John Winston Lennon real life got in the way while I was busy making other plans.

I've been programming more than 20 years and so having owned a mac for a huge part of that time yet never bothering to find the time and motivation to learn how to develop for the platform I had chosen is sort of embarrassing when put like quite starkly like that but old dogs `can` learn new tricks and so that's the very purpose of this account or blog posts series.

I am going to attempt to learn the Swift programming language and develop some stuff for iOS, iPadOS and maybe even WatchOS or Mac itself. Who knows...

### How am I going to do it?

Well, like many others I'll be going for a mixed media learning style and therefore will be working my way through some Udemy courses, I've bought a bunch of iOS/swift titles for my kindle and I'll see what I can absorb from the vastness of the web with the intention of stewing it and reducing it down to some nuggets that can be regurgitated here with the hope that they help me remember how and why and if anyone else gets any value from them at all then that's an absolute cherry on top too.

In keeping with the popularity of the #100days type series that can be found for most programming languages I will use the #100daysOfSwift as the pace and driver for this series, the other materials mentioned above will be aimed at supplementing the essentials covered in Paul Hudson's 100days course. If you're not aware of Paul Hudson you can find his course [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/)

### Surely I'm just covering well trodden ground?

Probably! It might be old hat for you, not for me. Now I doubt Swift has anything wildly new or any paradigm shifts that other languages don't because lets face it, most modern languages are a _hot take_ on two or three classics with some added FP concepts such as map and reduce, a few syntactic tricks and maybe some flagship libraries and a great logo.

### What's my rig?

I'm using a 2016 series MBP that was fully upgraded at the time so in 2021 it's a little roadworn but still has a respectable roadworthiness about it. I don't have an M1 based mode, an iPhone or indeed an iPad, but that's fixable. In the meantime it's probably going to be a few posts before I'm touching anything that needs an actual physical device anyway and with the potential of a new iPad pro looming in April 2021 and the iPhone13 leaked I might hold off for a bit to get the newest of the new.

So let's get to day #1 of [100daysOfSwift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100)

### Variables and constants

Swift determines some rules of using values based on mutability. Mutability as in `can it be changed?` or `It cannot be changed` - where a variable is mutable and allows us to change it then it is declared using the `var` keyword in swift. Where it is not allowed to change and is therefore a constant we use the `let` keyword. If Mental picture paint a thousand words then imagine variable has been sliced in two with a sword and all you have left is var, for constant you can imagine a town crier screaming at volume LET IT BE KNOWN....

### Strings, string interpolation and integers

Strings are a character sequence, this article is arguable one large string, or many strings that could be consumed as one large string. Some languages don't have a type for Strings and will model it as an array of individual characters, but Swift has a primitive type called string. We use double quotes to determine the start and end points of a String.

```swift
var someStringValue = "This is the value of a string variable"
```

String interpolation is the ability to place variables inside a string. It has vast uses and typically looks like the following.

```swift
var name = "Swiss Tony"

// some other code
print("It belongs to \(name))
```

Integers are whole numbers like, 1, 206, 522, 19 or 6007. Swift uses type inference and therefore declaring a variables and initialising it with an integer (whole number value) will typically make it an `Int` type when you type check it. For very large numbers swift also allows us to use underscores as thousand separators therefore we can sometimes see syntax like the following.

```swift
var smallNumber = 125
var biggerNumber = 1_255_755_650
```

### Type annotations

Swift has type inference as part of the language, however it is possible to use annotations to be explicit about a variables type. Adherence to using annotation may be part of a style guide or used sparingly and only where absolutely necessary.

```swift
var thisNumber = 100          // using type inference the type will be Int
var thatNumber: Int = 100     // using annotation, Int is the type as set explicitly
var otherNumber: Double = 100 // type is Double ven though initialiser number could be mistaken for an Int
```

Those sections cover off what is related to day#1 on Paul's 100daysOfSwift course and therefore concludes this introductory post. I'll be back with more tomorrow.

Best wishes and be well.
